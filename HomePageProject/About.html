                    <P> My favorite sport is Basketball. 
                        I have enjoyed playing basketball since high school. My position is PF(Power Forward) and Center. 
                        I still play basketball as a club at Kangwon National University</P>

                <h2 id ="SubHead">FC Seoul</h2>
                <P>  I am a supporter of FC Seoul in the k-League. 
                    FC Seoul is a prestigious club in the K-League and has many fans. 
                    This season, the club recruited famous soccer player, Jesse Lingard.
                    I believe this club will have a top performance this season.

                <P>  I'm a fan of the band NELL.
                    I've been a big fan of this band since I was in middle school, and I'm still a fan of them.
